# Configuration file directives

### error_page:
```
Syntax: error_page code ... [=[response]] uri;
Default: —
Context: global, server, location
```
Defines the URI that will be shown for the specified errors. Example:
```
error_page 400		/400.html;
error_page 500 501	/50x.html;
```

### client_max_body_size:
```
Syntax:	client_max_body_size size;
Default: client_max_body_size 1m;
Context: global, server, location
```
Sets the maximum allowed size of the client request body. If the size in a request exceeds the configured value, the `413` (Content Too Large) error is returned to the client. Different size unity can be accepted (k, K, m, M, g, G). Example:
```
client_max_body_size 10M;
client_max_body_size 1g;
```
Note: Define maximum size allowed, if the value is higher than our max we either reject the config file or set it to the default setting.

### server:
```
Syntax: server { ... }
Default: —
Context: global
```
Sets configuration for a virtual server.

### listen:
```
Syntax: listen address[:port];
Default: *:80;
Context: server
```
Sets the address and port for IP on which the server will accept requests. Both address and port, or only address or only port can be specified. An `address` may also be `localhost`, for example:
```
listen 127.0.0.1:8000;
listen 127.0.0.1;
listen 8000;
listen *:8000;
listen localhost:8000;
```

### server_name
```
Syntax: server_name name ...;
Default: server_name "";
Context: server
```
The server_name is like a filter that tells our server: "Hey, if you receive a request with this domain name in the Host header, use THIS server block to process it."
Sets names of a virtual server, for example:
```
server {
	server_name example.com;
}
```
Note: Nginx has a regex captures that we dont't handle, just like regular expressions creating variables that could be later used in other directives.

### root
```
Syntax: root path;
Default: root /var/www/html;
Context: server, location
```
Sets the root directory for requests. Example:
```
location /i/ {
    root /data/w3;
}
```
The `/data/w3/i/top.gif` file will be sent in response to the “`/i/top.gif`” request.
Note: again, not handling variables.
A path is constructed by adding a URI to the value of the `root` directive.

### index
```
Syntax: index file ...;
Default: index index.html;
Context: server, location
```
Defines files that will be used as an index. Files are checked in the specified order.

### location
```
Syntax:	location uri { ... }
Default: —
Context: server
```
Sets configuration depending on a specified URI
Note: We do not accept nested location contexts

### allow_methods
```
Syntax: allow_methods ...;
Default: allow_methods GET|POST|DELETE;
Context: server, location
```
Allowed method for the current context

### autoindex
```
Syntax: autoindex on|off;
Default: autoindex off;
Context: server, location
```
Enables or disables directory listing

### upload_to
```
Syntax: upload_to /path;
Default: —
Context: server, location
```
Defines the path to upload files to. Has to be combined with POST method

### return
```
Syntax:	return code URL;
Default: —
Context: server, location
```

### alias
```
Syntax:	alias path;
Default: —
Context: location
```
Defines a replacement for the specified location. Example:
```
location /i/ {
    alias /data/w3/images/;
}
```
On request of “`/i/top.gif`”, the file `/data/w3/images/top.gif` will be sent.

### cgi_path
```
Syntax:	cgi_path path;
Default: —
Context: location
```
Path to the CGI interpretor, Example:
```
location /cgi-test {
	cgi_path /usr/bin/python3;
}
```

### cgi_ext
```
Syntax: cgi_ext extension;
Default: —
Context: location
```
Defines the extention of file executed via CGI. Needs `cgi_path` directive. Example:
```
location /cgi-test {
	cgi_path /usr/bin/python3;
	cgi_ext .py;
}
```

# Configuration error management

As we globaly decided to follow nginx behavior, we also tried to mimic at our best its configuration file error management.
To do that, we followed this article about [common nginx syntax errors](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/common-nginx-syntax-errors).

This was not enough so during the logic implementation we had a `nginx` Docker container instance opened to manualy modify the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` and check the specific error message.

> checking with the `nginx -t` commands return either 0 with a `test is successful` or 1 with a specific message detailing the error.

We are then loging the errors in the `/var/log/error.log` just like nginx does in the `stderr`.

Our logs are not perfect, the way we designed the parsing and the validation part - and the data structures we used - could not allow us to have all the informations that nginx provides, but we have the main informations and we're happy with it.
